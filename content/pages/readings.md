Paper 2a: Identification of a factor that determines if donor HSCs are compatible with the recipient.

Bach, F. H., and D. B. Amos. "[Hu-1: Major Histocompatibility Locus in Man](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/156/3781/1506)." _Science_ 156 (1967): 1506-1508.


{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
It had recently been shown that HSCs exist. The question was how to determine if HSCs from one individual would be able to reconstitute the hematopoietic system of another individual. If the procedure failed the recipient would die. How did this paper reduce the risk for patients receiving HSC transplantations?

Paper 2b: HSCs from siblings are used to treat a deadly genetic disorder.

Gatti, R. A., H. J. Meuwissen, H. D. Allen, R. Hong, and R. A. Good. "[Immunological Reconstitution of Sex-linked Lymphopenic Immunological Deficiency](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(68)92673-1/abstract)." _Lancet_ 2 (1968): 1366-1369.


{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
This paper is one of the first that demonstrates a clinical application for HSC transplantations. The paper describes the first successful human bone marrow transplant for an illness other than cancer. Why were only boys in this family dying from this disorder? Why was this child cured using HSCs from his sister? What complications could have been expected?

Gene delivery vehicles engineered from viruses

Paper 3a: Discovery of RNA-dependent DNA-polymerase in retrovirus.

Temin, H. M., and S. Mizutani. "[RNA-dependent DNA Polymerase in Virions of Rous Sarcoma Virus](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v226/n5252/abs/2261211a0.html)." _Nature_ 226 (1970): 1211-1213.


{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
In 1970 Howard Temin and his postdoctoral student Satoshi Mizutani announced that they had detected a viral enzyme that was able to transcribe single-stranded viral RNA into DNA. Temin and Mitzutani were the first to figure out how retroviruses work. This paper and the accompanying paper by David Baltimore resulted in awarding of the Nobel prize to Temin and Baltimore. How did Temin prove the existence of an RNA dependent DNA polymerase? How did this paper forward the field of gene therapy? Why was the discovery of an RNA dependent DNA polymerase important for the whole field of molecular biology?

Paper 3b: A method to deliver genes for gene therapy using modified human immunodeficiency virus.

Naldini, L., U. Blomer, P. Gallay, D. Ory, R. Mulligan, F. H. Gage, I. M. Verma, and D. Trono. "[_In vivo_ Gene Delivery and Stable Transduction of Nondividing Cells by a Lentiviral Vector](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/272/5259/263)." _Science_ 272 (1996): 263-267.


{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
Twenty six years after the previous paper was published much more was known about retroviruses. Research involving the lentivirus HIV had been intense, and the knowledge led to unexpected uses of the virus. This paper describes the production of "safe" lentiviral vectors that can be used for gene therapy. The last author Didier Trono, is now the Dean of Life Sciences at the Swiss equivalent of MIT. What are the risks of using retroviral vectors based on HIV for gene transfer into human cells? How did these authors get around some of these risks? How can a virus particle be engineered to target specific cell types?

Treating genetic disorders by fixing the bad gene.

Paper 4a: The first successful gene therapy trial.

Cavazzana-Calvo, M., et al. "[Gene Therapy of Human Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID)-X1 Disease](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/288/5466/669)." _Science_ 288 (2000): 669-672.


{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
The first successful gene therapy trials described in this paper were both a huge success and a failure for the field of gene therapy. For the first time it was possible to genetically correct HSCs from patients with X-SCID. Why was this trial conducted on X-SCID patients and not on patients with another monogenetic disorder? Was the chance of success higher in this group or was the risk-benefit ration particularly high? How can we know that the genetic defect was corrected in HSCs of cells transplanted to these children?

Paper 4b: Leukemia develops in patients treated with gene therapy.

Hacein-Bey-Abina, S., C. Von Kalle, M. Schmidt, M. P. McCormack, N. Wulffraat, P. Leboulch, A. Lim, C. S. Osborne, R. Pawliuk, E. Morillon, R. Sorensen, A. Forster, P. Fraser, J.

Soulier, L. Leiva, M. Wissler, C. Prinz, T. H. Rabbitts, F. Le Deist, A. Fischer, and M. Cavazzana-calvo. "[LMO2-associated Clonal T Cell Proliferation in Two Patients After Gene Therapy for SCID-X1](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/302/5644/415)." _Science_ 302 (2003): 415-419.


{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
Two years later this paper appeared. The bad news is that 2 out of 9 patients from the X-SCID study had developed T cell leukemia. Was this a result of gene therapy? Why did the patients get similar forms of T-cell leukemia? Would you have stopped the clinical trial based on the risk of developing leukemia? What are the options for these children?

RNAi: Using an ancient defense against viral infection to turn off disease genes

Paper 5a: Discovery of RNA interference, a mechanism and tool for specific down regulation of gene expression.

Fire, A., S. Xu, M. K. Montgomery, S. A. Kostas, S. E. Driver, and C. C. Mello. "[Potent and Specific Genetic Interference by Double-stranded RNA in Caenorhabditis Elegans](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v391/n6669/abs/391806a0.html)." _Nature_ 391 (1998): 806-811.


{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
In 1998 Fire and Mello published this groundbreaking study in which they found to their surprise that double-stranded RNA caused a potent and specific gene silencing while single-stranded antisense RNA had only a modest effect. Why was this discovery so important? Is it possible that this evolutionarily conserved mechanism of silencing gene expression from double stranded RNAs was developed as a protection against pathogens?

Paper 5b: Development of a method to deliver and regulate RNA interference to cells using lentiviral vectors.

Wiznerowicz, M., and D. Trono. "[Conditional Suppression of Cellular Genes: Lentivirus Vector-mediated Drug-inducible RNA Interference](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC167245/)." _J Virol_ 77 (2003): 8957-8961.


{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
This paper describes lentiviral vectors that mediate down-regulation of specific genes in target cells. How was the gene-silencing effect of RNA interference delivered to cells? How can you turn this silencing on and off? Where does the tetracycline-resistance operon (tetO) come from? What are possible applications of this method?

Future of personalized medicine using induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells

Paper 6a: Reprogramming fibroblasts to pluripotent stem cells that are similar to embryonic stem cells.

Takahashi, K., and Yamanaka, S. "[Induction of Pluripotent Stem Cells from Mouse Embryonic and Adult Fibroblast Cultures by Defined Factors](http://www.cell.com/abstract/S0092-8674(06)00976-7)." _Cell_ 126 (2006): 663-676.


{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
This is one of the most important scientific publications in recent years. What are the differences among HSCs, embryonic stem (ES) cells and iPS cells? Why is this paper important in the context of ethical considerations of stem cell research?

Paper 6b: Proof of principle that reprogramming of fibroblasts may be used for cell therapy of genetic hematological disorders.

Hanna, J., M. Wernig, S. Markoulaki, C. W. Sun, A. Meissner, J. P. Cassady, C. Beard, T. Brambrink, L. C. Wu, T. M. Townes, and R. Jaenisch.

{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
Here the potential of iPS cells as treatment for genetic disorders is demonstrated. What is a "humanized sickle cell mouse"? How is the genetic defect corrected? How are iPS cells converted into HSCs? What are the obstacles to overcome before this approach can be used in the clinic?
